# Cricbuzz-App
I built a Cricbuzz app clone using C++ and SFML graphics, learning valuable coding and app development skills in the process. As a cricket enthusiast, I enjoyed developing an app with all the features fans love. I'm proud of what I achieved and look forward to future opportunities to use my skills to innovate.
